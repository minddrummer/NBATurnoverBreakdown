NBATurnoverBreakdown
====================

I work for the Bulls and this is the code I use to parse the play by play data from NBA.com to create a turnover breakdown

In the NBA turnovers are bucketed into various categories (Lost ball, Bad Pass, Out of Bounds etc.)
For this script, you enter the NBA.com url and it reads the play by play data from that url.  It then
appropriately marks the turnover type for each player and aggregates the data into a excel file.  It also 
adds in the running total of the turnovers.  This script only works for the Bulls currently (as I work for the Bulls)
but if you would like to update it for any other team simply change the roster I have to include any other teams roster.
